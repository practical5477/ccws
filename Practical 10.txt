Practical 10

Here's your complete **copyable code and step-by-step guide** for **Practical 10: Implementation of OpenStack with User and Private Network Creation**, as described in the uploaded PDF.

---

## ☁️ Objective:
Install and configure **OpenStack** on Ubuntu using **DevStack**, including setting up users and private networks.

---

## 🔧 Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu system (18.04/20.04 recommended)
- sudo privileges
- Internet connection

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

---

### 🔁 Step 1: Update and Upgrade System

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
```

Reboot the system:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Or

```bash
init 6
```

---

### 👤 Step 2: Create a Stack User

Create a user for running DevStack:

```bash
sudo useradd -s /bin/bash -d /opt/stack -m stack
```

Grant sudo privileges:

```bash
echo "stack ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/stack
```

Switch to the new user:

```bash
sudo su - stack
```

---

### 🔧 Step 3: Install Git (if not installed)

```bash
sudo apt install git -y
```

---

### 📥 Step 4: Download DevStack

```bash
git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-dev/devstack
```

---

### 🛠️ Step 5: Create `local.conf` Configuration File

Navigate to devstack directory:

```bash
cd devstack
```

Create the config file:

```bash
nano local.conf
```

Paste the following configuration (update `HOST_IP` based on `ifconfig`):

```ini
[[local|localrc]]

# Password for KeyStone, Database, RabbitMQ and Service
ADMIN_PASSWORD=StrongAdminSecret
DATABASE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
RABBIT_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD
SERVICE_PASSWORD=$ADMIN_PASSWORD

# Host IP - Run `ip addr` or `ifconfig` to get this
HOST_IP=192.168.56.103
```

Save and exit:
- Press `ESC`, then type `:wq` and hit Enter.

---

### 🚀 Step 6: Install OpenStack

Run the installation script (this will take 10–20 minutes):

```bash
./stack.sh
```

DevStack installs:
- Nova (Compute)
- Glance (Images)
- Keystone (Identity)
- Cinder (Block Storage)
- Horizon (Dashboard)
- Neutron (Networking)
- Swift (Object Storage)

---

### 🌐 Step 7: Access OpenStack Dashboard

After installation, you’ll see a link like:

```
http://<your-ip-address>/dashboard
```

Use:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `StrongAdminSecret` (or your set password)

Open it in a browser to access the web dashboard.

## 🎯 Conclusion:
You've successfully installed OpenStack and can now create:
- Users
- Projects
- Networks
- Virtual machines
